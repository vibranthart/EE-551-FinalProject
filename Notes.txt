Notes:

you would have multiple users
2 ways:

    - have host share screen and audio

    - synch websites -> one person submits the video link (Youtube) -> youtube opens on both users and synchs up, so when one pauses the othe rpuases at the same time

-step 1: make client text -> test user interactions (done)(touch ups
-step 2: make decisions -> 
                    1: view video request 
                    2: send a message 
                    3: idk just in case we need'
-step 3: opening the link 
-step 4: synchcronized viewing -> Youtube

-we could make a GUI
-we add voice chat
-one view for everyone
